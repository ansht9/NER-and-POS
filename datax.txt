Biography: 
Adriene Jenik is an artist and educator who resides in the desert. Her computer and media art spans several decades including pioneering work in interactive cinema and live telematic performance. 
Jenik's artistic projects straddle and trouble the borders between art, science, engineering and popular culture and have been written about in The New York Times, published in The Drama Review, and recognized by the Rockefeller Foundation. She was an early member of the Paper Tiger Television collective (1985-91) and a founding member of the Deep Dish TV Alternative Satellite network. Her video productions include the video short, "What's the Difference Between a Yam & a Sweet Potato?" (with J. Evan Dunlap), and the award-winning live satellite TV broadcast, "EL NAFTAZTECA: Cyber-Aztec TV for 2000 A.D." (with Guillermo Gómez-Peña and Roberto Sifuentes). "MAUVE DESERT: A CD-ROM Translation" is Jenik's internationally acclaimed interactive road movie based on the novel Le Désert mauve by French Canadian author Nicole Brossard. Her creative research project, DESKTOP THEATER was a series of live theatrical interventions and activities in public visual chat rooms developed with multi-media maven Lisa Brenneis.
In 2014, she shifted her creative practice to focus on issues related to the US desert: environmental resilience, military testing and training, and indigenous values. Her ongoing series of DATA HUMANIZATION performances recast endurance work for our time. DRYLAB2023 (with co-director Marco Janssen and 8 participants) imagined a near future of water scarcity that was enacted over 30 days in an experiment in extreme experiential learning. Most weekends she can be found in a public space offering her performance of CLIMATE FUTURE READINGS with her ECOtarot deck. She is also a singer/songwriter and published poet.
Jenik received her BA in English from Douglass College, Rutgers University and her MFA in Electronic Arts from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. A founding professor of the Interdisciplinary Computer Arts Major at the University of California, San Diego and the Digital Culture program at Arizona State University, Jenik has taught electronic and digital media to generations of students. She currently serves as Professor of Intermedia in the School of Art at ASU, affiliate faculty in the School for the Future of Innovation in Society and a Senior Global Futures Scientist at the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory.

Alesha Durfee https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/808338 Alesha.Durfee@asu.edu College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Professor Biography: 
  Alesha Durfee (she/her/hers) is a Professor of Sociology in the School of Social and Family Dynamics. Her research, teaching, and service focus on intersectionality, structural intersectionality, social justice, policy and domestic violence, including mandatory arrest policies and protection orders, using quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods. Her work has been published in journals such as Gender & Society, Violence Against Women, Feminist Criminology, Journal of Interpersonal Violence, Journal of Family Violence, Journal of Marriage and Family, Politics & Society, Global Public Health, and  Feminist Teacher. She was the Associate Director for Graduate Studies for the School of Social Transformation from 2018-2019, the Graduate Director for Women and Gender Studies from 2014-2017, and was the co-President and President-Elect for the ASU Faculty Women's Association.
She is currently working on a book manuscript, Domestic Violence and Structural Intersectionality: The Unintended and Collateral Consequences of "Victim-Friendly" U.S. Law and Policy. She received a writing fellowship (2019) from the Women's International Study Center in Santa Fe, New Mexico to work on the manuscript, and has presented parts of the book at the European Domestic Violence Conference, the University of New Mexico, and the University of California - Irvine School of Law. The framework for the book was recently published in Violence Against Women (2020) as an article: "The use of structural intersectionality as a method to analyze how the domestic violence civil protective order process replicates inequality" (https://doi.org/10.1177/1077801220958495).
She has had two federal Researcher-Practitioner Partnership grants - one from the National Institute of Justice (2016-2018; with Mesa Municipal Court and the National Center for State Courts) to study institutional and contextual factors that influence protection order filing and issuance rates using both quantitative and qualitative data, and a second from the Center for Victim Research (2018-2019; with Mesa Municipal Court) to estimate victimization rates and the need for victimization services for Community Court defendants. Her passion is working with community partners to create practitioner-informed, policy-relevant research using mixed methods.
She previously had a National Science Foundation (2012-2014; with Dr. Jill Theresa Messing) to analyze legal mobilization among domestic violence survivors, including the decision to file for a protection order, how the legal system is perceived by domestic violence survivors, and the costs and benefits of filing for an order for survivors.
Other research projects include gender and community/problem-solving courts, protection order "cross filings", the arrest decision in cases of domestic violence reported to law enforcement, the consequences of mandatory and pro-arrest policies for domestic violence, the social construction of domestic violence victimization, and how gender influences how narratives of violence are constructed and interpreted in the justice system. She has also served as a guest co-editor (with Dr. Madelaine Adelman and Dr. Jill Theresa Messing) for a special issue of Violence Against Women on gender violence and transdisciplinarity. 
She has been recognized as a "Badass Woman of ASU" (ASU HerStory Project), a "Catalyst" for helping to create a more inclusive and diverse campus (Committee for Campus Inclusion) a "Distinguished Mentor" (CLAS Residential College), and has been nominated for ASU Professor of the Year and the Centennial Professorship Award. In 2008 she received the Monalee Ewing Naming and Claiming Women's Space award for her contributions to undergraduate education at ASU and was also recognized in the "Hands of Change" calendar by the Intergroup Relations Center at ASU. She has led the School of Social Transformation's Clothesline Project since 2014 (https://sst.clas.asu.edu/clothesline-project). As a part of the project, she links students with campus and community organizations (such as domestic violence shelters and local schools) to do domestic violence education, outreach, and advocacy.
She teaches undergraduate and graduate courses on domestic and sexual violence, social policy, quantitative and mixed-methods, and gender and crime. Prior to coming to ASU, she volunteered as a domestic violence victim advocate for the Seattle Police Department, and she continued her community service as a board member of the Purple Ribbon Council (a grassroots organization which works to prevent domestic violence through education and outreach).

Arvind Varsani https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/3050059 Arvind.Varsani@asu.edu School of Life Sciences Associate Professor Biography: 
Arvind Varsani is a molecular virologist who works across ecosystems from plants to animals and from the tropics to polar regions. His research uses a combination of traditional virology, microscopy (including transmission electron microscopy), molecular and cellular biology techniques in conjunction with modern sequencing techniques, synthetic biology and bioinformatics to characterise viruses and understand their dynamics.
Studies over the last decade have shown that viruses are the most common and abundant entities on earth, yet very little is known about their evolutionary dynamics and roles in ecosystems. Our current knowledge of viruses is heavily biased to those that cause disease in humans, animals and plants. This knowledge equates to a very small portion of the viral diversity on the planet and hence a very minute fraction of the virome associated with humans, animals and plants. Over the last decade Arvind Varsani and his collaborators have focused on addressing diversity, demographics and evolutionary dynamics of viral communities in various ecosystems.
Arvind Varsani’s broader objectives are to: 1) study viral dynamics in Ross Sea (Antarctica) ecosystem which is recognised as anthropogenically the least-altered marine system on the planet with no evidence indicating introduction or range expansion of any species thus far, despite its changing physical environment; 2) unravel the viral evolutionary dynamics as a consequence of climate change; 3) study viral ecological interaction networks within a microbiome and more broadly within phytobiomes in order to unravel the dynamics of pathogen emergence.

Research Interests: 
I work across ecosystems, from plants to animals, and from the tropics to the Antarctic with a strong focus on viral evolution and dynamics, and viral metagenomics. My research uses a combination of traditional virology, microscopy (including transmission electron microscopy), molecular and cellular biology techniques in conjunction with modern techniques including next-generation sequencing, synthetic biology and bioinformatics. A brief overview of my current research projects is provided below.
Darren Martin (author of the most widely used recombination detection software; South Africa) and I have set up a wide collaborative network of scientists world-wide to study viral evolution though recombination, viral phylogeography and global viral movement patterns of the plant-infecting geminiviruses and nanoviruses. While initially our research was based in Africa and South America, recently we have also focused on the Pacific region. As a team, Philippe Roumagnac, Pierre Lefeuvre, Darren Martin and I are attempting to identify drivers of plant viral emergence in ecosystems.
In collaboration with Mya Breitbart, Karyna Rosario and Milen Marinov, I have embarked on a unique concept of using top end insect predators to sample viromes in various ecosystems. Additionally, my group has recently started looking at human and animal viruses vectored by black flies and mosquitoes in New Zealand and the pacific islands.
I have an active avian circoviurs disease research program with the Department of Conservation of New Zealand, Parc Zoologique et Forestier (New Caledonia), Bethany Jackson (Murdoch University, Australia), Tomasz Stenzel (University of Warmia and Mazury, Poland) and Tomasz Piasecki (Wrocław University of Environmental and Life Sciences, Poland).
I am running a variety of viral discovery projects associated with various animals in the US, fruit bats in the pacific island of Tonga, various fungi, farm animals, insects and molluscs in New Zealand.
In a collaborative effort, David Ainley (penguin ecologist, USA), Grant Ballard (penguin ecologist, USA), Stacey Kim (marine ecologist, USA), Jennifer Burns (seal ecologist, USA) Melanie Massaro (avian ecologist, Australia), Joseph Levy (permafrost geologist, USA), William Davison (fish physiologist, New Zealand) and I are exploring the diversity of viral communities in the Antarctic.

Beate Peter https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/2432764 Beate.Peter@asu.edu College of Health Solutions Assoc Professor Biography: 
Beate Peter, Ph.D., CCC-SLP, is an Associate Professor in the College of Health Solutions. Peter heads the Speech/Language Genetics lab, which is home to three lines of research: genetic etiologies of communication disorders, gene-brain-behavior links in communication dis-/abilities, and early and proactive interventions for children at genetic risk for communication disorders. The Speech-Language Genetics Lab has launched the first clinical trial of early intervention in infants who have a known genetic risk for speech and language disorders. We call this program the "Babble Boot Camp." The first children in the pilot cohort have completed the 2-year prevention program and follow-up assessments, suggestive of beneficial treatment effects.  A fully powered clinical trial, funded with an NIH R01 grant, started in April 2019.
Peter's lab at ASU is equipped with a 128-channel EEG system. Her paper on diminished neural adaptation ("gating") in adults with dyslexia describes how responses to the second of two tones were not suppressed until 200 ms after the onset of the tone, whereas this suppression took place before 100 ms in typical adults. This paper is the electrophysiological account of gating anomalies in dyslexia that had been described in a 2016 paper using MRI technology. Whereas the MRI paper contributed information on brain regions, our paper contributed information on the time course of gating. The journal Clinical Neurophysiology chose our paper to highlight on the journal's social medial platforms.

Peter’s doctoral research in the Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences at the University of Washington focused on subtypes of childhood speech disorders based on behavioral traits. During her three years of postdoctoral studies in the Division of Medical Genetics at the University of Washington, she received training in molecular and statistical genetics and became the first and only clinical linguist to complete the Graduate Certificate in Statistical Genetics. Subsequently, as research assistant professor at the University of Washington and funded with an NIH grant, Peter investigated genetic etiologies of severe speech disorders in multigenerational families. At ASU, her work on gene-brain-behavior networks is the logical next arena.
Peter designed a new PhD concentration in speech and hearing science called "Translational Genetics of Communication Abilities (TGCA)," with its first graduate in 2018. This interdisciplinary program of PhD training allows students to investigate a broad range of communication abilities in terms of their genetic etiologies and clinical translations.
As a member of the American Society of Human Genetics and as past member of the Scientific and Professional Education Board at the American Speech, Language, and Hearing Association, Peter initiated and drives efforts on a national level to provide training in genetics for health professionals. At her initiative and with her participation, the online Certificate in Clinical Genetics for Health Professionals has launched in the College of Health Solutions at Arizona State University. https://courses.cpe.asu.edu/browse/college-health-solutions/courses/certificate-in-clinical-genetics . Peter's adjunct appointment at Saint Louis University reflects the fact that she created a course in clinical genetics for graduate students in speech-language pathology at that university and teaches it there on a regular basis.

I co-developed and co-teach this  course with Dr. Nancy Scherer. We have been teaching it every year from 2015 to 2018, then we obtained  a unique course number for it, SHS 568. Overview: SLP caseloads can be highly diverse and include  cases with communication challenges due to a variety of medical causes. Here, the SLP becomes a  member of an interprofessional team. This course covers basic knowledge of etiological aspects (genetics,  embryology) and clinical assessment/intervention issues relevant for children with complex medical and  developmental disabilities that impact communicative development.    SHS 542 Applied Methods in Neuroscience, 2 semester credits. First taught in Fall 2019. I co-developed  this course with my junior colleagues in Speech and Hearing Science for the new MS program in Auditory  and Language Neuroscience; we also developed the whole program together, with Dr. Rogalsky and me  heading this effort. This course is not officially team-taught but I provide lectures for one week each time it  is taught. Overview: The course covers fundamental topics of experiment design and their applications in  Auditory and Language Neuroscience. Students will learn about the fundamentals of experimental design  and their application in psychoacoustics, EEG, ERP, and MRI. A series of hands-on activities will require         Beate Peter | CV | March 2022 | P. 16 of 23   that students analyze existing experiments and a final project will require that students design a new  experiment.    SHS 702 Scientific Writing and Presentation 2, 1 semester credit. Co-developed with Dr. Yi Zhou as a  required course for the new Ph.D. concentrations in Speech and Hearing Science. Overview:  This course  is a continuation of Scientific Writing and Presentation Part 1. The focus of this seminar is to help students  develop skills in producing written and oral reports of research products, become competent in delivering a  podium presentation, and learn how to address reviewer comments and audience members.     SHS 598 Special Topics: Molecules, Markers, Management: Introduction to Genetics, 2 semester  credits. First taught 2015, it was approved for a unique course number as SHS 544 Foundations of  Genetics: DNA, Health, and Society, 3 Semester credits, in Fall 2021. Overview: This genetics course  equips students to evaluate research papers in genetics, to understand clinical implications relative to their  own fields, and to debate complex societal issues involving genetics. It course fulfills partial requirements  for the new Ph.D. concentration “Translational Genetics of Communication Abilities (TGCA)” in Speech  and Hearing Science.    SHS 494 Introduction to Genetics: Molecules, Markers, Management (2 semester credits): Taught  concurrently with SHS 544 as the undergraduate version.     SHS 598 Special Topics: Fundamentals of Cortical Electrophysiology I (2 Semester Credits). I  designed this course as the first in a two-part series and taught it twice. Taught in 2016 and 2018.  Overview: This course is the first of a two-course series designed to equip students with a foundational  understanding of cortical electrophysiology.      Program Development in Speech and Hearing Science   Ph.D. Concentration in Speech and Hearing Science “Translational Genetics of Communication  Abilities (TGCA).”   I created this concentration in 2016 and serve as its director. The first student graduated with this  concentration in 2018. The following brief overview can be found at https://chs.asu.edu/programs/speech- hearing-science-translational-genetics-communication-abilities-phd: “The translational genetics of  communication abilities concentration within the PhD program in speech and hearing science provides  doctoral students with training in an innovative approach to the clinical sciences (pioneered at ASU) where  the concepts of precision medicine are applied to all disciplines within communication sciences and  disorders. Training in molecular genetics and bioinformatics equips students to investigate the interactions  among genetic, brain-based and behavioral traits. Prior training in genetics is not required. Knowledge of  genotype-phenotype associations provides the foundation for the translational components of this  program: early identification and intervention, individualized management and interprofessional  approaches. Students have the option of focusing primarily on basic sciences aspects, on clinical  translations, or on both.”     MS in Auditory and Language Neuroscience   Together with my colleagues Drs. Berisha, Daliri, Luo, Rogalsky, and Zhou, I created this new program in  2018. Dr. Rogalsky and I served as the initial program leads. My contribution is to forge collaborations with  industry, e.g., MagStim, Philips, and Advanced Bionics, to ensure a good fit of the program with the needs  in industry. The first cohort of students started in Fall 2019. A brief overview of the program can be found  at https://chs.asu.edu/programs/auditory-and-language-neuroscience-ms: “The MS degree program in  auditory and language neuroscience trains scholars in basic and applied research in the fields of auditory  and language neuroscience to prepare them for doctoral-level graduate studies as well as for positions in  science, health care and industry. In addition to cutting-edge coursework in neuroscience, this program  also includes hands-on training in instrumentation such as neuroimaging, neurophysiology and clinical  research applications. Students develop a strong foundation to conduct impactful neuroscience research  related to auditory and language processing and human communication.”      Adjunct Faculty at Saint Louis University   CSDI 589 Summer Institute “Molecules, Markers, Management: Genetics for Clinicians.” Approved for 2.75  CE credits by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

Brian Smith https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/843330 BrianHSmith@asu.edu Partnership for Community Development Professor Biography: 
Brian Smith is an inaugural Trustees of ASU  Professor. He is a behavioral neuroscientist who studies how animals learn about odors in order to predict important events, such as an encounter with food, a mate or predator. His research employs detailed behavioral studies of learning and memory. He and his research team also use a combination of electrophysiological, bioimaging, molecular and computational techniques to directly link changes in behavior to changes in the brain.
Professor Smith’s research focuses on learning and memory systems in both insects and mammals. His work is being applied to studies of human diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as well as to the negative effects of heavy metal poisoning on learning and memory.

My research since beginning my Ph.D. studies in  1978 has involved a consistent trajectory toward integrating new technologies into my research program on  odor-guided behavior, which together with collaborators in other disciplines has allowed me to ask questions  at different levels of biological analysis. I joined the faculty in the School of Life Sciences at Arizona State  University in July 2005, after having spent 15 years on the faculty at Ohio State University. I began working  in Chemical Ecology for my graduate studies by analyzing the chemical signals social bees use to recognize  nestmates. My work involved isolating and analyzing chemical signals bees used in this important form of  social communication. At the time my colleagues and I speculated about how the brain processes and learns  about complex chemical signals. This interest led to my move to Berlin, Germany to work with Prof Randolf  Menzel, and the n to Prof John Hildebrand in Arizona, which was the start of my training in Neuroscience.  Those moves ultimately placed me on the trajectory toward my current NIH-funded research program on  olfactory coding and behavioral plasticity with honey bees, which involves electrophysiology, bioimaging,  computational  and  molecular  investigations  of  olfactory  processing  and  learning.  More  recently  I  have  reached out to integrate work with fruit fly and mouse models to test hypotheses derived from the work with  honey bees. Finally, researchers in my laboratory are now working with colleagues who treat Parkinson’s  patients and manage a bank of brains from autopsies of these patients. We are testing models derived from  our work with insect and mice of how alpha-synuclein affects processing in the olfactory bulb.    I have had continuous federal funding to study olfaction from NIH, NSF-CRCNS and now the Human  Frontiers  Science  Program  since  1991.  My  Google  Scholar  profile  with  relevant  citation  statistics  is  available online. I am a AAAS Fellow, I have received funding from the German Academic Exchange  Service, and I am currently a Senior Fellow of the Zukunftskolleg at the University of Konstanz in Germany.   Expertise    My core expertise lies in investigating what animals know, how they know it and what are the rules for  translating  that  knowledge  into  behavior.  These  studies  are  crucial  for  understanding  how  odors  are  represented,  discriminated  and  classified  in  the  CNS.  My  laboratory  performs  detailed  analyses  of  the  mechanisms  that  are  involved  odor-guided  behavior,I  have  developed  nonassociative  and  associative  conditioning paradigms, mostly with insects (fruit fly, moth and different bee species). But I have also  published  work  with  birds,  rats  and  now  mice.  Since  1986  this  work  has  integrated  behavior  with  electrophysiology, bioimaging, molecular genetics and computational modeling to understand the neural  mechanisms that underlie odor discrimination and plasticity. My research has extended to studies of operant  conditioning (e.g. signaled avoidance), categorization/classification, and multimodal integration of odors  with  contextual  cues  from  other  stimulus  modalities.  Finally,  I  have  published  studies  that  integrate  economic models of rational choice comparing insect and bird foraging behavior.    My original interest, which brought me to study olfaction, lies in analyzing natural odor signals, which  are  almost  invariably  complex  mixtures  of  many  chemical  elements.  My  recent  interest  has  turned  to  analyzing the ‘scene’ statistics of the natural stimulus space. My laboratory, for example, is now using for  behavioral, electrophysiological and imaging experiments synthetic blends of odors designed to mimic the  composition and variation of natural odors. This is an area that is poorly understood in olfaction, relative to  visual and auditory processing, where much more effort has been devoted to understanding the physical  properties of the stimulus space. By this I mean that we need a multidimensional analysis of how odor  objects that have the same meaning vary (variance, skewness, kurtosis) in both space and through time. This  is in my opinion one of the central challenges that must be addressed in order to understand how and why  the CNS has evolved to process odors.            21   Contributions to Science   The insect Antennal Lobe is the analog to the mammalian Olfactory Bulb, and several lines of evidence  indicate that the networks of the AL and OB process olfactory sensory information in the same way. Over  the years my laboratory has adopted or developed the means to record activity in the AL and more central  brain regions using bioimaging and electrophysiology in such a way that awake, behaving conditioned and  naïve animals can be compared. More important, we have developed hypotheses about the function of the  plasticity for olfactory coding and perception.

PMID:  30167457   We have adapted several techniques used in basic research to apply more broadly to pollinator health.   All species of honey bees are used all over the world for honey production and pollination, and their  contribution to agricultural productions are irreplaceable. Yet in many areas the health of honey bees has  been threatened by many factors. We have shown how the behavioral and physiological measure we  employ for basic research can be applied to assess and understand how factors such as toxins (heavy  metals, pesticides, fungicides) and environmental stressors (humidity and temperature) have important  sublethal effects on honey bees. I have taught workshops on these techniques to academic researchers and  beekeepers in the US, Chile and Saudi Arabia, and I have now workshops planned in China.

Christopher Stojanowski https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/852133 Christopher.Stojanowski@asu.edu School of Human Evolution and Social Change Professor and Director Biography: 
Christopher Stojanowski is a bioarchaeologist who specializes in the analysis of human skeletal remains and dentition. He uses information from ancient sites to reconstruct the lives of past peoples, focusing on the Holocene skeletal record of the New World and Africa. He has written on community organization and ethnogenesis in the colonial Southeast, Archaic period human biological variation in North America, and Early and Middle Holocene climatic adaptations in the Sahara Desert. He is interested in dentition, generally, spatial analysis, and multivariate analysis of complex phenotypes. He is currently PI of the Gobero Archaeological Project focusing on North African prehistory and is Director of the Global Dental Phenomics Database whose goal is to archive and disseminate human dental cast data from around the world.

In particular, I’d like to highlight my leadership in initiating the equity committee.  In 1991, I and several other NARST members were concerned that research addressing the participation of women in science did not have a high profile among the NARST community nor was there a committee or strand addressing the issue of gender equity. As a consequence, I spearheaded a group that discussed the absence of any formal mechanisms to address gender equity in NARST policies, publications, representation in leadership positions, and forums for the presentation of research with several of the leadership of NARST. Although a gender equity committee was discouraged by some of the leadership I spoke with, I moved forward and with the help of other like-minded NARST members and proposed to the board that a gender equity committee be established. The board accepted my proposal and an ad hoc committee was created and I led that committee from 1992-95. The committee subsequently became a standing committee and the scope of the concerns enlarged to address equity issues relating to other under-represented groups. As a consequence the name of the committee was changed to simple the Equity committee.    	  	My research has also has had a strong focus on gender issues in science education. One of the my publications, written with my  graduate student Rosemary Leary, addressing girls in science ( Letting Girls speak Out About Science) was selected for the JRST issue featuring the most influential research in the past 40 years of the Journal of Research in Science Teaching.  This publication advocated that we not compare females to males and was a single sex study of what girls had to say about their interests in and attitudes about science. This research was influential in changing how research concerning issues of girls and women in science were viewed and how the research was conducted. On the basis of my research in gender equity I was made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2004 and a Fellow of the American Educational Research Association in 2009. In addition, under my co-editorship of JRST, we published the first article addressing homosexuality and a review, in the form of an editorial, documenting the lack of published research in JRST addressing gender equity. I have also worked with colleagues in Japan investigating and promoting gender equity in science education. On my vita publications, presentations, and activities with an asterisk all address the issue of gender equity issues in science.    	  	My continuous contributions to science education began 33 years ago as a graduate student.  I have been a regular presenter at NARST for all but one of those 33 years when I was on sabbatical and could not return to the United States.  I have continued to publish in the area of gender equity while expanding my focus to teacher professional development and engineering education as well as advocating for more engineering education research at NARST. Much of my current work places my graduate students as lead authors on my grant funded research in order to support their development as scholars. Grant funding ($15,528,020) has supported research in science education, as well as collaboration with colleagues in science and engineering departments.

Daniel Dinn-You Liou https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/2210847 dliou@asu.edu MLF Teachers College Associate Professor Biography: 
Daniel D. Liou is an associate professor of educational leadership at the Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College at Arizona State University. His research examines the sociological manifestations of expectations in the organization of classrooms, schools, and society, contextualizing educational practices in relational, curricular and institutional terms. Liou is an elected member and the president of the Los Angeles College Prep Academy School Board.
Liou serves as an appointed associate editor for four academic journals: (1) Review of Educational Research, (2) Education Policy Analysis Archives, (3) International Journal of Modern Education Studies, and (4) the Journal of Educational Studies and Multidisciplinary Approaches. Additionally, he is on the editorial board for the Journal of Multicultural Affairs, the International Journal of Critical Media Literacy, and the Educational Foundations and Social Justice Education Journal.
In 1996, Liou was recognized by the Berkeley Unified School District for his advocacy work with immigrant students and families, and in 1997 Berkeley High School presented him with the Excellence Service Award for building an effective family-school engagement program with the bilingual community. He twice received the Most Inspirational Award from the University of California at Berkeley for creating a K-12 outreach program to pair undergraduate mentors with first-generation, immigrant, and refugee students to support their college-going expectations. From 2015-2020, Liou served as an appointed member of the Equitable and Inclusive Practices Advisory Council at the Arizona Department of Education. In 2015, he was awarded the Social Justice Teaching Award in Educational Leadership from American Educational Research Association, and in 2017, the Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College recognized him as its Outstanding Promising Research Scholar.
Liou earned his BA (high honors) in Asian American studies at University of California, Berkeley and MEd in administration, planning, and social policy at Harvard University. He completed his doctorate in social sciences and comparative education with sub-specialization in race and ethnic studies in education at University of California, Los Angeles. Liou was raised in a low-income, immigrant, single-parent household. He was the first in his family to graduate from high school and college, giving him a unique perspective into the strengths and aspirations of traditionally marginalized student populations.

Google Scholar Profile
Research Interests: 
Dr. Liou’s research examines three interrelated themes regarding how the sociology of expectations fosters conditions of equity and justice in the educational pipeline: curriculum and instruction; school and community leadership and transformation; and higher education. His work contributes to the national and international conversation on education in three major ways. First, he examines the ways in which the sociology of expectations is manifested through teaching, leadership, and organizational practices. Second, he encourages the shifting of the mindsets and belief systems of PK-20 educators from deficit-based to asset-based perceptions of Students of Color. And finally, he works to activate social justice beliefs and expectations to ignite asset models of education, reaffirming the knowledge and humanity of marginalized communities.
Dr. Liou is the author of more than 50 peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, technical reports, and other publicly accessible scholarship. His most recent work has been published in Journal of Latinos and Education, Educational Administration Quarterly, and Race Ethnicity and Education. Courses

Federico Sanabria https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/746314 Federico.Sanabria@asu.edu Psychology Associate Professor and Director of DEIB Committee Biography: 
Federico Sanabria is an associate professor in the Department of Psychology at Arizona State University. He received his professional degree in psychology from the Universidad de los Andes (Bogotá, Colombia), and his master's and doctorate in experimental psychology from the State University of New York (SUNY) at Stony Brook, under the mentorship of Dr. Howard Rachlin (animal models of choice and self-control). He joined Arizona State University in 2004 as a postdoctoral research associate, under the mentorship of Dr. Peter R. Killeen (quantitative models of motivated behavior; animal models of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and Dr. Janet L. Neisewander (psychopharmacology, with an emphasis on nicotine). In 2008, he joined the faculty in the Behavioral Neuroscience program in the Department of Psychology. He studies basic behavioral and cognitive processes underlying behavioral regulation in various species, and applies this research to the study of psychiatric disorders, primarily substance abuse and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Aside from maintaining a productive laboratory (47 empirical, peer-reviewed publications by 2017), and training and mentoring graduate and undergraduate students, Professor Sanabria has taken multiple leadership roles, including president of the International Society for Comparative Psychology (ISCP), member of the Board of Directors of the Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior (SEAB), member of the Executive Board of the Society for the Quantitative Analysis of Behavior (SQAB), program board coordinator for the Annual Convention of the Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI), and associate editor for Learning & Behavior, and the Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior.

Research Interests: 
Experimental research on basic behavioral and cognitive processes underlying behavioral regulation in various species, and the application of this research to the study of psychiatric disorders, primarily substance abuse and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Processes include learning, timing, choice, and response inhibition.
Research Group: 
Real-time models of behavior. The main purpose of these models is to analytically isolate changes in motivation, learning, and sensorimotor capacity in free-operant performance, such as during the acquisition, maintenance, and extinction of food and drug self-administration. Together, these models have been used to account for spontaneous exploratory behavior (Cabrera et al., 2013), Pavlovian conditioning (Killeen et al., 2009), instrumental behavior (Brackney et al., 2011; Daniels & Sanabria, 2017a) and its disruption (Brackney et al., 2017), adjunctive behavior (Íbias et al., 2015, 2017), choice (Sanabria & Thrailkill, 2009), and timing (Daniels & Sanabria, 2017b). An introductory video is available here.
Response inhibition capacity (RIC). Impulsivity is a broad construct that encompasses multiple behavioral problems, including a reduced capacity to withhold reinforced responses. This capacity is known as response inhibition capacity (RIC); its deficit is a characteristic of multiple psychiatric disorders, including depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Our laboratory has validated a method for assessing RIC in animal models (Watterson et al., 2015). We have applied this method to demonstrate (for the first time!) a methylphenidate (Ritalin)-induced enhancement and a stress-induced reduction of RIC in rats (Hill et al., 2012). We have also shown that nicotine reduces RIC in an animal model of ADHD (Mazur et al., 2014). We are currently adapting this method to study RIC in healthy and genetically modified mice. 
Temporal and spatial control of behavior. Our laboratory is concerned with dissociating timing processes from non-timing processes embedded within instrumental behavior (Daniels & Sanabria, 2017b). To accomplish this, our laboratory has examined a novel timing paradigm, has compared performance in this task across species, including humans, and has examined the sensitivity of task performance to nicotine administration. On the spatial dimension, we have demonstrated the contribution of spatial variables (motion and correlation) to Pavlovian sign-tracking (Cabrera et al., 2009; Mazur & Sanabria, 2011). On the olfactory dimension, we have begun exploring how odors are represented in the brains of mice.

Designed, organized and ran two major annual West Point leadership conferences (SCUSA), providing top cadets from 13 academic departments, and key faculty members, with the opportunity to engage in deeper understanding of current events, while encouraging free flow of ideas/exchanges with experts from public/private sectors. These conferences foster new relationships between military and civilians and produce policy recommendation reports, new ways of thinking and doing, along with academic and trade publications that reach top policy makers influencing strategy reform.  SCUSA 50 in 2013, inspired authorship of two influential books about U.S. foreign policy and strategy, both published in 2014.  Advanced in only 8 years from Assistant to Full Professor – approximately 4 years ahead of normal average.        Leader of Taskforce on Veterans Transition Program Effectiveness and Reform  OSD/DOD, the Armed Services, VA, and DOL                                                          		2010 - 2012  Requested by DOL, by name, while an active duty officer with DOD, to be appointed as special military advisor to Assistant Secretary of Labor for veteran employment and transition services.   Selected by top army officials to lead key taskforce focused on addressing crisis among returning home veterans, where increasing rates in suicides, domestic violence, substance abuse and high level of unemployment were alarming.    Formed and led multi-disciplinary, cross-functional team of experts from six US military academic disciplines, two U.S. Army centers of excellence, and representatives from Department of Labor (DOL) and Veterans Affairs to assess the state of current services provided.   Coordinated and held numerous, worldwide sensing-sessions (small groups and 1-on-1 sessions), with soldiers, their families, program administrators, and other key supporting agencies experts, to get at the root cause of program ineffectiveness.   Led overall project analysis, using scientific methods to validate challenge at hand, identified major causes, and wrote the summary report.   Formulated 18 specific recommendations/improvements, ranging from short-term, no cost, quick-hit actions, to more elaborate, cost and labor-intensive IT infrastructure and systems upgrades schemes. Most proposals have been or are in the process of being implemented as part of national-level program improvement undertaking, including the White House’s Joint Forces Initiative led by Michele Obama and Jill Biden.  Wrote formal directives, from and for military officials, which were sent to troops, disseminating information about fundamental changes in the program (i.e. making it mandatory), its benefits to ALL participants/users, while also raising awareness and accountability of military leaders for the wellbeing of their service members, not only during active duty, but also upon their return home.   Planned, organized and executed the first ever gathering of key senior leaders representing DOD, Armed Services, VA, and DOL, allowing participants venue for candid, collegial, and collaborative dialogue about how to best provide transition assistance programs.

Directed team of 40 planners and developed scalable plans from phase 0/pre-conflict to phase 3 & 4/execution & transition. Strategies varied from traditional “kill/combat” missions through “restoration” of basic public services to local civilians.  Conceived and tested population-centric counterinsurgency concepts and practices (like living with local populations, building trust, “closing to restore” vs. “closing to destroy”), which formed fundamentals for new field manual (FM 3-24) and later led to strategy shift in war approach in Iraq in 2007, and Afghanistan in 2009.   Demonstrated strategic advisory, consulting, and advanced planning capabilities and acumen to counsel Commander and leadership staff on all combat, stability/support, civil-military, counter-terrorism, and counter-insurgency operational plans, actions, and activities, including matters of strategic and political implications, specifically related to Turkish and Iraqi-Kurd interactions and Iraq-Arab senior leader engagement.

Devised and orchestrated plans for unit re-organization, from an old model to new, modular, plug-and-play division prototype.  Striking changes in global security environment demanded a holistic and comprehensive change in how US military forces manned, trained, equipped, organized, and developed its military soldiers and officers.  It was also the most comprehensive change in the US military affairs since the American Civil War, and impacted the full spectrum of sub-organizations including: Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership & Education, Personnel, Facilities, Policy and funding (DOTMLPF-F).   The 101st ABN Division was the first Army unit to fully complete this transformation.  Plans that were developed and executed became “the blueprint” for ALL subsequent unit transformations, a historic undertaking for US military.

Research includes field research in East Africa, summer 2013.  	  			Project Summary: With the re-deployment of US forces from hostile action in Iraq and Afghanistan 			and with the ‘build-down’ efforts across DOD, AFRICOM’s model of an interagency operation 			aimed at other than phase 3 operations will likely gain momentum across other geographical 			regions. In such a ‘preventing conflict’ construct, with a small, economy of force military footprint, 			it is imperative that operators and policymakers identify the most appropriate strategic effects for 			sustainable and effective shaping, deterrence, and stability operations and for restoring order as 			rapidly as possible through kinetic operations when appropriate -- PREPARE-PREVENT-PREVAIL. 			With a focus on East Africa, the aim of this research is to: (1) identify and develop the appropriate 			strategic effects across the range of military operations (ROMO) to ensure the right force structure 			and resources for ‘other than’ phase 3 operations; and (2) identify the appropriate strategic effects to 		retain across the ROMO to ensure the right force structure and resources to execute phase 3 			operations, with a focus on near-peer and regional competitors.  	  	2011-2013	Fellow, The Mentor Group Symposium on Statecraft and the Armed Services, Washington, D.C. 			and New York City  	  		This Symposium serves United States Armed Forces career officers who deployed to Afghanistan 			and Iraq combat theaters. US Officers believe that human dignity, human rights, justice and 			economic affairs are of the art of statecraft, an art officers honed in the field without its formal 			designation. Officers share battlefield and post-conflict experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq with 			Symposium Principals, who reciprocally (1) deepen the officer’s understanding of achievements in 			the field; (2) share and formalize this understanding between European and US peers; (3) forge an 			art of statecraft specific to his profession, his allies and their homelands.  	  	  	2010-2012	Bard College-West Point Just War Project – Joint Undergraduate Seminar and Professional 			Academic Conference  	  			Purpose:   	For cadets:  To enable a selected group in their final semester who are majoring in these three departments to benefit from the multi-disciplinary strengths of both West Point and Bard in the exploration of a topic that has considerable importance to them both personally and professionally as officers.  		For faculty:  To promote scholarship as well as professional contact with fellow academics.  The opportunity of contributing to a conference whose papers are already planned for publication will encourage interest and commitment throughout the seminar.   		For West Point:  To establish a model of fruitful academic cooperation with Bard College for the sake of academic enrichment of both cadets and faculty.   	  	** Faculty from three academic Departments at West Point, Law, English and Philosophy, and Social Sciences conducted a joint seminar with colleagues from Bard College in the Spring of 2012.   The topic was the tradition and nature of a Just War.  The seminar was immediately followed by a scholarly conference on the same topic hosted by Bard College, followed by publication of conference papers.  The project involved the following disciplines: West Point:  Law; Philosophy; Political Science. Bard College:  Classics; Political Science; Religious Studies (Christianity, Asian religions, Islam, Judaism).

Organized by the Eisenhower Project in collaboration 			with members of the Department of Social Sciences, United States Military Academy at West Point, 			the conference is an extension of ongoing efforts by the two organizations in recent years to hold 			lively and constructive debate between civilian and military thinkers in order to bring greater depth 			and sobriety to the public discourse on U.S. foreign and defense policy in the years ahead.  		  		With sponsorship from the Open Society Institute, the event is a one-day invitational conference, 			divided into four bilateral discussions between thinkers and practitioners from a range of civilian 			and military disciplines.  Reflecting the concerns of its planners, this inaugural event places a special 		emphasis on the Civilian-Military and Military-Media relationships at this crucial moment of 			national transition and, accordingly, takes place immediately following the first hundred days of the 			new Obama administration and 111th Congress.

MINERVA RESEARCH INITIATIVE (MRI) Finalist Proposal (2008-09)  	  		Summary: A common feature of war over that past two decades has been the salience of 				religion as an intervening, if not primary, source of contention between warring factions.    		As a result, the need to understand how religion influences military outcomes has become   		urgent. It comes as no surprise then, at a time when a majority of U.S. military land forces   		are deployed in the Middle East, that there have been many calls for research on Islam, and 			especially Islamic terrorist networks.  But the widespread attention given to Islam in recent 				years betrays a common assumption – that any obstacles religion poses to successful military 			outcomes will come from the religious organizations and institutions controlled by the 				opposition; that is, a concern primarily if not wholly with Islamic extremism .  Because this 			assumption has shaped research on religion and war, the latter offers only a limited view of 			the kinds of influences that religion might have on military operations. Specifically, to date, 			there have been no studies examining how military operations are affected by religion in 				general, and more specifically the Christian NGOs and evangelists that follow the military into 			war zones.  The proposed program of research is aimed at filling this critical void in the social 			scientific study of military intervention.

Co-authored the Afghanistan-Pakistan Civil/Military Campaign Plan, shifting focus of the U.S. and NATO-ISAF efforts in Afghanistan in the wake of President Obama’s change of strategic focus (i.e., 27 March Remarks on Afghanistan and Pakistan), to the delivery of results for the civilian population and government of Afghanistan through integrated, synchronized efforts of our civilian and military teams working across lines of Security, Development, Governance, and Information.    Immediately following the U.S. Secretary of Defense decision to initiate a 60-Day Strategic Review of all civilian and military operations in Afghanistan, adapted advisory and planning roles, participating directly in the Joint Operational Planning Group (JOPG) conducting the SDIA raising attention to and amplifying focused discussion both in the SDIA and the ICMCP on the key counterinsurgency principle of developing local popular support essential to separating the population from the insurgency. .

Led efforts in socializing the new Integrated Civ-Mil Campaign Plan (ICMCP) with all 42 NATO and other Troop-Contributing Nation (TCN) military planners.

Focused advisory and planning efforts specifically in the areas of triage and dissection of the Insurgency/Taliban threat and on incorporation of effective population-centric COIN tactics and techniques influencing changes in COMISAF Strategic Guidance.    Advised on, coordinated, and planned the incorporation of new pop-centric COIN philosophies and techniques and new strategies to build integrated civilian-military teams, from national to provincial, district, and local level COIN efforts (i.e., PRTs; DSTs) and to build/enhance local popular support.

Research Interests: 
Prof. Jeff Yarger's research program is interested in understanding the role that local structure and dynamics plays in controlling the physical and mechanical properties of a wide range of technologically and biologically important, but disordered, materials. Systems currently under investigation include spider silk fibers and biopolymers, protein clusters, polyamorphic materials, nano-particles and quantum dots, battery and fuel cell materials, and most recently diabetes related research. Most of this research is highly interdisciplinary and many projects involve collaborations with the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory, the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and with other faculty in Chemistry and Biochemistry, Materials Science, Physics and Molecular Biology. Central to ongoing research is the use and development of solid-state NMR and MRI techniques applied to elucidate local structure and dynamics in disordered materials.
Spider silk is a remarkable biopolymer, a light weight protein fiber which spiders produce for diverse purposes including web structure, prey immobilization, making egg cases and are a key to their survival. With a unique combination of high elasticity, mechanical strength and toughness, its superior material properties surpass those of any currently known man-made fiber. In addition, these fibers are biocompatible and biodegradable. It is one of the best examples of block copolymers in Nature in which repeating structural motifs are linked together covalently resulting in polymers that organize themselves into a variety of nano-structures with exceptional material properties. The figures and illustrations shown on the web page provide some recent examples of NMR, X-ray, Raman, IR and Brillouin results by our research group. These results are published in several papers and are examples of our groups' efforts to understand the mechanical and physical properties of spider silks at the molecular level.
Organic and Bioorganic ligand capped nanomaterials is another major research thrust within the group. Specifically, we are exploring the ligand capping chemistry of metal, metal oxide and semiconducting nanoparticles and quantum dots at the molecular level. The group is developing new NMR, X-ray and laser light scattering instruments and methods for elucidating the molecular structure of nanomaterials. For example, Gold nanoparticles (1-5 nm diameter AuNPs) capped with organic ligands are frequently used in catalysis, biomedicine and nanotechnology. Below is a figure from a resent paper where our group developed a facile synthesis for trioctylphosphine capped gold (Au) nanoparticles.
Prof. Jeff Yarger's research program has research labs in ISTB1 on the Tempe Campus as ASU. This is also the location of the Magnetic Resonance Research Center, which Prof. Yarger is the founding director. I picture of our research group and collaborators at ASU is shown with everyone on the staircase of our 800 MHz NMR system. Besides labs at ASU, part of Prof. Yarger's group is at Argonne National Labs and at the Spallation Neutron Source at ORNL.
